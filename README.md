# Notes for Functional JavaScript

I took these "notes" while reading
[Functional JavaScript][fun-js-site] by [Michael Fogus][fogus-site].

All of the code in the book is [available online][fun-js-code].

## So, what's this, then?

These are specs I wrote in jasmine to help me follow along.

Source is in `js/`. Specs are in `spec/`.

Run all the specs with `npm test`.

Start up a watcher and run specs on changes with `npm start`.
